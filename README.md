My single page personal site.

## Setting up the dev environment
1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `npm run dev` to watch `.scss` files in `./assets/scss/` directory for changes

### Notes
`npm run build` will pre-compile all SCSS and minify it. Ideal to use before pushing changes up to git and deploying, but Netlify will do that automatically.
